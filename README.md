# Why should I use CEngine over Unity or GameMaker?
CEngine is completely open-source and free to work with as well as providing a simplified, intutitive development environment. Many other engines are not as intuitive as CEngine is intended to be, so CEngine is the perfect place to start programming as it ranges through all levels of complexity.
